Librtas provides a set of libraries for user-space access to the
Run-Time Abstraction Services (RTAS) on the ppc64 architecture.

librtas.so
This library that allows user-space programs to make RTAS calls which 
provide support for low-level system hardware configuration and operations, 
such as getting hardware sensor (temp, fan speed, etc.) data, setting the 
operator panel LEDS, getting hardware error logs, injecting artificial 
hardware errors (for testing), getting VPD (Vital Product Data), and 
loading new firmware.

librtasevent.so
This library provides a set of definitions and useful routines for
analyzing RTAS events, such as parsing out the sections of an RTAS event
and printing the contents of a RTAS event in human-readable form (used
by many of the RAS tools on ppc64).

Building & Installing:
----------------------
To compile, do the following:

make 
su - root
make install
/sbin/ldconfig

Endian Concerns:
----------------
RTAS expects integer values to be in a 32 bit, big endian format.  This
requirement will be handled by librtas except when values are passed
to or from RTAS via a buffer.  In this case, we expect the caller to handle
the endianess of these values.  The librtas calls that employ this 
method are listed below:

rtas_cfg_connector
rtas_errinjct
rtas_get_indices
rtas_get_sysparm
rtas_get_vpd
rtas_lpar_perftools
rtas_set_sysparm
rtas_update_nodes
rtas_update_properties
